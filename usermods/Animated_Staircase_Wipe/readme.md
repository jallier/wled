This is a usermode to combine the animated staircase with the staircase wipe usermod.

This is because the animated staircase mode operates on segments, which leads to jerky animations when you want to use a single segment. The staircase wipe mod doesn't handle the PIR sensors. So combine them to get the best of both worlds.
